		"My homelab - A self-hosted environment for learning and development.",

	description: `I have built a homelab project comprising two virtual environments, one of which includes a NAS (Network Attached Storage) and several development environments and labs where I am teaching myself Kubernetes and other best practices. Additionally, I have created a Kubernetes cluster hosting several websites and web services.
    
    All the above can be accessed remotely through a Zero trust implementation using Cloudflare tunnels and Microsoft Entra ID for authentication.
    
    Through my homelab implementation, I have also been teaching myself infrastructure as code, using Terraform and Ansible to automate the deployment of my environments and services. I have also been using CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment of my websites to a locally hosted kubernetes cluster.
    
    More information regarding this project can be found on my GitHub page.`,
